Project Overview: Implement a computer vision model to identify grocery items and suggest recipes based on available ingredients. Develop an interface to facilitate these features.

Scope:
Grocery Detection: Use a pre-trained model to scan and identify grocery items via a camera or smartphone.
Recipe Suggestions: Provide recipe recommendations using the detected groceries, factoring in user preferences (e.g., dietary restrictions).
User Interface: Create a simple UI for scanning items and viewing suggestions.

Key Features:
Grocery detection with pre-trained models.
Virtual pantry that tracks items.
Recipe suggestion engine using API integrations.
